# AI-Powered Air Quality Monitoring Dashboard

## Overview
Analyzing raw data can be complex and time-consuming. However, visualizing this data through charts and graphs simplifies interpretation, making patterns more apparent. The addition of interactive elements further enhances usability, allowing users to explore data effortlessly.

## AI-Driven Insights
Monitoring air quality in real time and predicting future trends helps both authorities and individuals make informed decisions. This dashboard leverages AI-powered analytics to provide accurate forecasts and historical trends.

## Syncfusion WPF SfChart
  This high-performance [charting library](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/charts/getting-started) is designed for WPF applications and offers rich data visualization capabilities. It supports **various chart types**, including spline and line charts, making it ideal for tracking real-time air pollution levels and forecasting future trends using AI-driven insights. With built-in interactivity features such as **zooming**, **panning**, and **tooltips**, users can explore complex datasets with ease.

## Syncfusion WPF SfMap 
  This feature-rich mapping control enables dynamic geographical visualization of air quality data. It supports multiple projection types, **shapefiles**, and **data binding**, allowing users to analyze pollution levels across different regions. With interactive **zooming**, **panning**, and **customizable markers**, [SfMap](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/maps/getting-started) enhances spatial analysis by providing a clear and insightful representation of environmental data.

## Why Use AI for Air Quality Monitoring?
Traditional monitoring relies on sensor networks and government reports, which may not always provide real-time insights. By integrating Azure OpenAI with Syncfusion [WPF SfChart](https://www.syncfusion.com/wpf-controls/charts), our dashboard delivers instant and predictive air quality analytics, thereby improving decision-making for users.

## Troubleshooting
### Path too long exception
If you are facing a path too long exception when building this example project, close Visual Studio and rename the repository to a shorter name before building the project.
